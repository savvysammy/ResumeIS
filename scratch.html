          <p> It is Christmas Eve in the late nineteenth century at the Von Stahlbaum home. Excitement runs high as last minute preparations are made. Grandparents and guests begin to arrive to celebrate the holiday with Clara, Fritz and their parents. Arriving late in the midst of the celebration is Herr Drosselmeyer, Clara's mysterious godfather. He entertains everyone with magic tricks and mechanical dolls. Clara begs to have one of the dolls for her very own, but Drosselmeyer denies her request. Instead, he presents her with a wooden nutcracker soldier. Fritz feels slighted and becomes angry. He grabs the nutcracker from Clara and in the struggle, the nutcracker is broken.

            Clara is devastated, but Drosselmeyer mends the nutcracker and the celebration continues. As the children grow weary, the guests depart, and Drosselmeyer disappears as mysteriously as he had arrived. Clara carefully places her beloved nutcracker under the Christmas tree before the family retires to bed.

            The house grows dark, and Clara steals back into the room to look at her precious nutcracker. The room is filled with the magical Christmas Spirit. As she falls back asleep on the couch, her thoughts are filled with exciting, happy memories of the Christmas Eve party and the dancing dolls. All too soon her thoughts are interrupted by her menacing brother Fritz. He calls mice from everywhere and leads them in a chase after Clara. Before her eyes, Fritz is transformed into the Mouse King. Clara calls Drosselmeyer, who summons the toy soldiers, but the Mouse King and his army are too strong for them. Drosselmeyer transforms the wooden nutcracker doll into a lifelike soldier. The nutcracker then leads the soldiers into battle. The mice appear to be winning. Clara, determined to help her nutcracker, strikes the Mouse King with her slipper. The mice are defeated and the battle is won!

            The Christmas Spirit guides them as the kingdom prepares for their arrival. A celebration is called to honor their defeat of the Mouse King. The Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier dance for Clara. Everything is so beautiful, and Clara's heart is filled with happiness. As the festivities draw to a close, Clara reluctantly waves goodbye to the Kingdom of Sweets and to all her new friends. Her dream-maker, Drosselmeyer, leads her safely home where the Spirit of Christmas will remain in her heart forever.
